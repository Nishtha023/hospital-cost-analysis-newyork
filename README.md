# Hospital-cost-analysis-newyork
Big data analysis of 1M+ hospital discharge records from New York State (2009-2017) examining cost drivers and patterns in healthcare. Uses MongoDB Compass for data cleaning and Tableau for visualization. Key findings: 0.98 charge-cost correlation, severity-based pricing validation, and actionable insights for hospitals, policymakers, and patients.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive big data analysis of hospital inpatient costs across New York State. It was built as part of my graduate coursework (ALY6110: Big Data and Data Management) using MongoDB Compass for data cleaning and Tableau for visualization. I analyzed **1,081,672 patient discharge records spanning 9 years** – from 2009 to 2017.

In today's healthcare landscape, understanding cost drivers is crucial for optimizing hospital operations, improving patient affordability, and supporting evidence-based policy decisions. This analysis delves into the relationships between illness severity, treatment complexity, hospital specialization, and actual costs. By leveraging big data analytics and interactive visualizations, I aim to uncover patterns, validate pricing transparency, identify high-cost outliers, and provide strategic recommendations to enhance healthcare efficiency and accessibility.

## 🎯 Target Audience

This dashboard is designed to provide valuable insights to stakeholders involved in healthcare management, policy development, and financial planning:

**Hospital Administrators** → To identify cost optimization opportunities and benchmark facility performance against peers.

**Healthcare Policymakers** → To develop evidence-based regulations and support preventive care investments in high-volume conditions.

**Insurance Companies** → To accurately assess risk profiles and calculate premiums based on severity-cost correlations.

**Patients & Advocates** → To understand typical cost ranges ($10K-$50K for 90% of procedures) and make informed healthcare decisions.

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Cost Distribution**: 80-90% of procedures fall between $1,000-$100,000
- **Pricing Transparency**: Strong 0.98 correlation between charges and actual costs
- **Severity Impact**: Clear 0.35 correlation between illness severity and treatment expenses
- **Volume Economics**: Inverse relationship – low-volume treatments are significantly more expensive
- **Top Cost Drivers**: Neonate procedures, organ transplants, and post-operative complications
